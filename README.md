# Hello, Adventurer! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm just an average human who occasionally types gibberish into a computer and hopes for the best. I enjoy long walks on the beach, debugging code at 3 AM, and pretending I know what I'm doing.

## Skills

- **Fluent Languages:** Hindi (my mother tongue), English (because apparently, everyone understands it), and Spanish (currently attempting to conquer, with varying degrees of success).
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript (because talking to computers is easier than people).
- **Tools:** I can't find my keys half the time, but I manage to navigate through Git somehow.
- **Other:** I have a black belt in procrastination and expert at finding creative ways to avoid meetings.

## Find Me Online

- **[Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/aintnodev):** When I'm not wrestling with bugs, I'm strategizing on the chessboard!
- **[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@aintnodev@mstdn.social):** I occasionally toot profound thoughts like "Hello, world!" and "Why is this code not working?"
- **[Email]():** Don't bother, I probably won't respond anyway.

## Fun Fact

I once wrote an entire program without a single runtime error. It was a dream, of course.
